# PLAN: IDEA Step

You're at the very beginning. Before any code, clarify the vision.

## What to Do

1. **Define the Problem**: What pain point are you solving? Be specific.
2. **Identify the User**: Who exactly will use this? Not "everyone."
3. **Explain Why Now**: What changed that makes this the right time?
4. **State the Unique Angle**: What will you do differently than existing solutions?

## Why This Matters

Most projects fail from solving the wrong problem. 10 minutes clarifying saves days of building wrong. The AI doesn't know your domain, constraints, or users. You do.

## Output

Create or update `docs/prd.md` with an initial section capturing the idea:

```markdown
# PRD

## Problem
[One paragraph describing the pain point]

## Audience  
[Specific description of who this is for]

## Why Now
[What changed that makes this timely]
```

## Next Step

Once the idea is captured, advance to PLAN:RESEARCH.

**Tip**: Talk to 3 potential users before writing code. Their words become your product.
